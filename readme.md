## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### Basic Usage
```python
import asyncio
from financial_light_rag_core import FinancialLightRAG, QueryParam

async def main():
    # Initialize system
    rag = FinancialLightRAG(working_dir="./data")
    
    # Process financial document
    financial_text = "Apple Inc. reported revenue of $383.3 billion..."
    result = await rag.ainsert(financial_text, "apple_10k")
    
    # Query with different modes
    response = await rag.aquery(
        "What are Apple's main revenue sources?",
        QueryParam(mode="local")
    )
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python demo_financial_rag.py
```

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### Different Retrieval Modes

#### Local Retrieval (Entity-Focused)
```python
# Best for specific company/metric queries
response = await rag.aquery(
    "What was Apple's iPhone revenue?", 
    QueryParam(mode="local")
)
```

#### Global Retrieval (Theme-Focused)
```python
# Best for thematic analysis across companies
response = await rag.aquery(
    "How do supply chain issues affect tech companies?",
    QueryParam(mode="global")
)
```

#### Hybrid Retrieval (Comprehensive)
```python
# Best for complex analysis requiring both specific data and context
response = await rag.aquery(
    "Compare Apple and Microsoft's cloud strategies and revenue impact",
    QueryParam(mode="hybrid")
)
```

#### Mix Retrieval (Graph + Vector)
```python
# Integrates knowledge graph and vector search
response = await rag.aquery(
    "What are the emerging risks in the technology sector?",
    QueryParam(mode="mix")
)
```

### Context-Only Retrieval
```python
# Get raw context without LLM generation
context = await rag.aquery(
    "What metrics are discussed?",
    QueryParam(mode="hybrid", only_need_context=True)
)
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple documents
documents = [
    ("Apple 10-K content", "apple_10k"),
    ("Microsoft earnings", "msft_earnings"),
    ("Tesla risks", "tesla_risks")
]

for content, doc_id in documents:
    result = await rag.ainsert(content, doc_id)
    print(f"Processed {doc_id}: {result}")
```

- **Example**: "What was Apple's iPhone revenue in Q3?"
- **Retrieval**: Focuses on specific entities and their direct relationships

### Global Mode  
- **Use for**: Thematic analysis, industry trends, cross-company patterns
- **Example**: "How do supply chain issues affect tech companies?"
- **Retrieval**: Explores themes and relationships across multiple entities

### Hybrid Mode
- **Use for**: Complex analysis requiring both specific data and broader context
- **Example**: "Compare Apple and Microsoft's cloud strategies and revenue impact"
- **Retrieval**: Combines local precision with global context

### Mix Mode
- **Use for**: Comprehensive analysis integrating multiple information sources
- **Example**: "What are the emerging competitive dynamics in cloud computing?"
- **Retrieval**: Integrates knowledge graph traversal with vector similarity

### Naive Mode
- **Use for**: Simple similarity search without graph intelligence
- **Example**: Quick keyword-based search
- **Retrieval**: Basic vector similarity search

## üöÄ Next Steps

This core system provides the foundation for:
1. **Web Interface**: Build Gradio/Streamlit UI
2. **API Service**: FastAPI wrapper for production deployment
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Graph visualization and analysis tools
4. **Domain Extensions**: Extend to other financial document types
